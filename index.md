I am a master student in Advanced Mathematics at the **[Master in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering (MAMME)](https://mamme.upc.edu)** from the Technical University of Catalonia.

I am doing research for the **Complex Systems Group** of the Institut d'Informatique of the Université de Neuchâtel (IIUN) and for the **Computer Architecture Department** of the Technical University of Catalonia.

Lastly, I am part-time building very web-cool things at [Alumniverse](https://alumniverse.com).

## About Me

My main research interests lie in the broad area of **systems**, **security**, and **networking**, with a strong mathematical foundation.
I am also highly interested in **formal methods**, verification and synthesis.

As a researcher at the IIUN, and under the supervision of [Valerio Schiavoni](http://members.unine.ch/valerio.schiavoni/), I am actively doing research with [Trusted Execution Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment), namely [Intel SGX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions) and [Arm TrustZone](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/security-ip/trustzone), and working on network emulation tools with the [Angainor Project](https://angainor.science).

For my MSc thesis, and with a grant of the [Department of Computer Architecture](https://www.ac.upc.edu/en/about-us), I am working on live migration of distributed container deployments using checkpoint/restore.
You can follow the development of the project in the [Github repo](https://github.com/lm-docker/criu-demos).

At [Alumniverse](https://alumniverse.com) I am a full-stack web developer.
Web was something I had never worked on, so they have agreed to let me on as a part-time engineer and so far I am enjoying the ride in `VueJS` and `Laravel-PHP`.
