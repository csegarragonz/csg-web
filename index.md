I am a last year PhD student at the Large-Scale Data and Systems Group ([LSDS](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/)) of the Imperial College London, under the supervision of [Prof. Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/).

My research addresses the design and implementation of secure, high-performance, runtimes for the cloud.
I am particularly interested in serverless and confidential computing.
Most of my work is open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/csegarragonz).
During my PhD, I have interned at Intel Labs and IBM Research.

I received a MSc in advanced mathematics, a BSc in mathematics, and a BSc in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC).
In the past, I have worked as a researcher for the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Nokia Bell Labs, the Swiss Center of Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM), the University of Neuchatel, and the UPC.
